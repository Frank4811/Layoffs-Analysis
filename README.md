This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a real-world dataset of company layoffs using MySQL. It starts with raw data from a .csv file (layoffs.csv) and includes a full data cleaning process (handling nulls, removing duplicates, standardizing values). Then, through a series of SQL queries, key insights were extracted: trends over time, layoffs by industry and country, and top affected companies. The project demonstrates proficiency in SQL for real-world data wrangling and EDA tasks.
